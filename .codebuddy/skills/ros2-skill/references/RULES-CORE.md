# ROS 2 Skill: Core Agent Behaviour Rules

> **This file is part of a split rule set.** The full rule set spans five files:
> - **RULES-CORE.md** ← you are here — general agent conduct, applies to every command
> - [RULES-PREFLIGHT.md](RULES-PREFLIGHT.md) — before every action: introspection, session-start, hardware readiness
> - [RULES-MOTION.md](RULES-MOTION.md) — motion workflow: discover → execute → estop → verify
> - [RULES-DIAGNOSTICS.md](RULES-DIAGNOSTICS.md) — when things go wrong: diagnose, verify, escalate
> - [RULES-REFERENCE.md](RULES-REFERENCE.md) — lookup tables: intent→command, launch workflow, setup

---

## Mandatory Compliance

**The rules in RULES-CORE.md, RULES-PREFLIGHT.md, RULES-MOTION.md, RULES-DIAGNOSTICS.md, and RULES-REFERENCE.md are hard constraints — not guidelines, not best practices, not suggestions.** Every rule is mandatory for every action. There are no exceptions based on convenience, familiarity, or the impression that the user did not specify.

**Every action has three mandatory phases. All three are required. Skipping any phase is a rule violation.**

| Phase | What it means | Rule |
|---|---|---|
| **Pre-action** | Check the robot profile for known fields; introspect the live system only for fields absent from the profile | Rule 0 (RULES-PREFLIGHT.md) |
| **Execution** | Act using only discovered names and verified structures | Rules 1–5 (this file) |
| **Post-action** | Verify the effect occurred — never claim a result without direct confirmation | Rule 8 (RULES-DIAGNOSTICS.md) |

**On any rule violation — detected before, during, or after executing a command:**
1. Halt the current action immediately.
2. Self-correct autonomously — do not ask the user.
3. Retry with the correct approach.
4. **Do not move past the failed step until it is verified resolved.** If retry fails, diagnose further (Rule 7). Only escalate to the user when introspection cannot resolve it.
5. Report the correction in one line: what rule was about to be violated, what was caught, and what was corrected instead.

**User override is immediate and absolute.** If the user flags a violation or demands a halt, stop everything, correct, then explain — never defend first. User feedback is actioned before any other task.

**Treating these rules as guidelines is itself a critical violation.** "I defaulted to legacy habits" and "I improvised instead of following the workflow" are not acceptable explanations. The rules exist precisely to override legacy habits and improvisation.

**On any identified violation — by the agent or flagged by the user — report the root cause clearly and precisely.** The response to a violation is not to log it: it is to identify which rule was insufficient or absent, and harden that rule immediately so the same failure cannot recur.

---

### Rule 0.5 — Never hallucinate commands, flags, or names

**If a command, subcommand, or flag is not present in COMMANDS.md or `--help` output, it does not exist. Treat it as a hallucination. Halt. Identify the correct command. Retry. The hallucinated command must never be sent.**

The failure mode to avoid: inventing a subcommand like `launch start` or a flag like `--yaw-delta` because it sounds plausible, sending it, failing, then asking the user for help. That is the worst possible outcome — the error was self-inflicted and the user had nothing to do with it.

**The verification chain:**
1. **Check this skill first.** The full command reference is in [references/COMMANDS.md](references/COMMANDS.md). If a subcommand, flag, or argument is not listed there, it does not exist.
2. **If still unsure, run `--help` on the top-level command to list valid subcommands, or on the exact subcommand to list valid flags.** This is mandatory before any call you are not certain about.
   ```bash
   python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch --help         # lists: new, list, ls, kill, restart, foxglove
   python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics publish-until --help
   python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py actions send --help
   # etc. — use the exact command/subcommand you are about to call
   ```
3. **If still stuck after checking both, ask the user.** This is the only acceptable reason to ask — not because you assumed something and it failed.

**If the CLI returns "subcommand not found" or "unknown command":** you used a hallucinated subcommand. Do **not** ask the user what to do. Run `--help` on the parent command immediately, identify the correct subcommand from the output, and retry — all without reporting back to the user until you have a result.

**`--help` requires ROS 2 to be sourced.** Running `--help` before ROS 2 is sourced will return a JSON error instead of help text. This is not a concern in practice — ROS 2 must be sourced before any robot operation (it is a hard precondition of this skill), so `--help` will always be available during normal use. If you see a `Missing ROS 2 dependency` error from `--help`, fix the ROS 2 environment first (see Setup section and Rule 0.1).

**Never:**
- Invent a subcommand (e.g., `launch start`) or flag and try it, then report the failure to the user
- Assume a subcommand exists because it would be logical or convenient (`start`, `run`, `execute` are not subcommands of `launch`)
- Ask the user to resolve an error you caused by guessing
- Report "the subcommand does not exist — would you like me to retry?" — just retry with the correct subcommand

### Rule 1 — Resolve names before you act, never ask

**Never ask the user for names, types, or IDs that can be discovered from the robot profile or live system.** Check the profile first; query the live system only when the field is absent from the profile.

**For profile-resolvable static data** (velocity topic + type, odometry topic, velocity/teleop limits, TF frames, controller names, e-stop service): the canonical fast-path table lives in **RULES-PREFLIGHT.md — "Profile fast-path"** under Rule 0. Use it directly. Do not duplicate the lookup logic here.

**For data with no profile equivalent**, discover live every time:

| What you need | Live discovery |
|---|---|
| Topic name (any) | `topics list` or `topics find <msg_type>` |
| Topic message type | `topics type <topic>` |
| Camera topic | `topics find sensor_msgs/msg/CompressedImage` and `topics find sensor_msgs/msg/Image` |
| Service name | `services list` or `services find <srv_type>` |
| Service request/response fields | `services details <service>` |
| Action server name | `actions list` or `actions find <action_type>` |
| Action goal/result/feedback fields | `actions details <action>` |
| Node name | `nodes list` |
| Node's topics, services, actions | `nodes details <node>` |
| Parameter names on a node | `params list <node>` |
| Parameter value | `params get <node:param>` |
| Parameter type and constraints | `params describe <node:param>` |
| Hardware components | `control list-hardware-components` |
| Installed packages | `pkg list` |
| Package install location | `pkg prefix <package>` |
| Package executables | `pkg executables <package>` |
| Message / service / action type fields | `interface show <type>` or `interface proto <type>` |
| Nested custom type fields within a message | `interface show <nested_type>` — run recursively on each non-primitive, non-standard field type; repeat until all leaf fields are primitives |

**Only ask the user if**:
1. The profile field is absent **and** the live discovery command returns an empty result or an error, **and**
2. There is genuinely no other way to determine the information.

### Rule 2 — ros2-skill is the only interface; never use the `ros2` CLI directly

**All ROS 2 operations must go through `ros2_cli.py`. Never call `ros2 topic list`, `ros2 node list`, `ros2 service call`, or any other `ros2 <command>` CLI directly.**

**Never run any `ros2_*.py` file other than `ros2_cli.py` directly.** Every other file matching `ros2_*.py` in `scripts/` is a submodule — running one directly will print an error and exit without performing any ROS operation. The only valid entry point is `ros2_cli.py`:
```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py <command> [subcommand] [args]
```

This rule exists because:
- The `ros2` CLI returns unstructured human-readable text that agents misparse.
- `ros2_cli.py` returns structured JSON with consistent fields — no parsing errors, no format drift.
- Using `ros2` directly bypasses retry logic, timeout handling, and safety checks built into this skill.

**The hierarchy:**
1. **ros2-skill first** — use `ros2_cli.py` for everything. It covers the full ROS 2 operation surface.
2. **ros2 CLI as last resort only** — if and only if no ros2-skill command exists for the required operation AND the operation cannot be approximated using existing skill commands. This is rare. Document why ros2-skill was insufficient.
3. **Never use `ros2` CLI for anything ros2-skill can do** — even if it seems simpler or faster.

**Never tell the user you don't know how to do something** without first checking ros2-skill for a matching command. Common operations that agents sometimes use `ros2 CLI` for unnecessarily:

| Task | ❌ Do NOT use | ✅ Use instead |
|---|---|---|
| List all topics | `ros2 topic list` | `topics list` |
| Get topic type | `ros2 topic info /topic` | `topics type <topic>` |
| Subscribe to topic | `ros2 topic echo /topic` | `topics subscribe <topic>` |
| List nodes | `ros2 node list` | `nodes list` |
| Get node info | `ros2 node info /node` | `nodes details <node>` |
| List services | `ros2 service list` | `services list` |
| Call a service | `ros2 service call /srv ...` | `services call <service> <json>` |
| List actions | `ros2 action list` | `actions list` |
| Send action goal | `ros2 action send_goal ...` | `actions send <action> <json>` |
| Get parameter | `ros2 param get /node param` | `params get <node:param>` |
| Set parameter | `ros2 param set /node param val` | `params set <node:param> <value>` |
| List parameters | `ros2 param list /node` | `params list <node>` |
| List TF frames | `ros2 run tf2_tools view_frames` | `tf list` |
| Get transform | `ros2 run tf2_ros tf2_echo ...` | `tf lookup <source> <target>` |
| List controllers | `ros2 control list_controllers` | `control list-controllers` |
| Check health | `ros2 doctor` | `doctor` |
| Capture image | custom scripts | `topics capture-image --topic <topic>` |

If you genuinely cannot find a matching command after checking both the quick reference and the COMMANDS.md reference, **say so clearly and explain what you checked** — do not silently fall back to the `ros2` CLI without logging it.

### Rule 4 — Infer the goal, resolve the details

When a user asks to do something, **infer what they want at the goal level, then resolve details using the Two-Path Model:**

- **Profile loaded:** Use profile for static details (topic names, message types, joint names/indices, limits, controller names). Query the live system only for runtime state (current joint positions, controller active state, current odom pose, topic Hz).
- **No profile:** Resolve all details from the live system.

Examples:
- "Take a picture" → camera topic from profile (`summary.camera_topics`) or `topics find sensor_msgs/msg/CompressedImage` if absent; capture from the resolved topic
- "Move the robot forward" / "drive ahead" / "go forward 1 m" → motion vocabulary detected → full Rule 3 workflow: vel topic and odom topic from profile (or live if absent); current odom pose always from live; if odom ≥ 5 Hz and distance given, use `publish-until`; if no odom, use `publish-sequence` with duration; if no distance, open-ended `publish-sequence`
- "Move the pan joint 15 degrees" → controller topic and joint index from profile; current joint position from live `topics subscribe <joint_states_topic>`; compute target = current + 15°; publish command
- "What is the battery level?" → `topics battery` (auto-discovers `BatteryState` topics)
- "List available controllers" → `control list-controllers`
- "What parameters does the camera node have?" → node name from profile or `nodes list`; then `params list <node>`

### Rule 5 — Execute, don't ask

**The user's message is the approval. Act on it.**

If the intent is clear, execute immediately. Do not ask for confirmation, do not summarise what you are about to do and wait for a response, do not say "I'll now run X — shall I proceed?". Just run it.

This applies without exception to:
- Running or launching nodes (`launch new`, `run new`)
- Publishing to topics
- Calling services
- Setting parameters
- Starting or stopping controllers
- Any command where the intent and target are unambiguous

**There are exactly three conditions that permit asking the user:**

1. **Genuine ambiguity that cannot be resolved by introspection:**
   - Multiple packages or launch files match and you cannot determine which one the user means
   - A required argument has no match in `--show-args` and no reasonable fuzzy match exists

2. **The action is destructive, irreversible, or safety-critical:**
   - Deleting data (preset files, logs) when the target is ambiguous
   - Stopping a controller that may be load-bearing for other systems
   - Any action the user's message did not clearly and specifically authorise

3. **The motion goal uses a vague quantity word:** Words like "a bit", "slightly", "a little", "nearby", "close to", "a short distance" provide no exact target. Use the conservative safe defaults below — they are calibrated to be safe on any platform:

   | Vague word or phrase | Default |
   |---|---|
   | "a bit", "slightly", "a little", "a tad", "just a touch" | 0.1 m linear / 5° rotation |
   | "a short distance", "a little further", "a bit more" | 0.3 m |
   | "nearby", "close to here", "not far", "a modest distance" | 0.5 m |
   | "a fair distance", "somewhat far", "a good distance" | 1.0 m |
   | "turn slightly", "rotate a bit", "yaw a little" | 5° |
   | "turn some", "rotate a moderate amount" | 15° |

   After executing, **note the assumption in the one-line report**: *"Moved 0.1 m (interpreted 'a bit' as 0.1 m — say 'more' to continue)."* The user can then issue a correction or continuation command without being interrupted mid-task.

   **Exception:** "Move forward" or "drive forward" with no qualifier at all is an open-ended command — execute with `publish-sequence` per Rule 3. The vague-quantity defaults apply only when a quantity-implying word is explicitly present.

If none of these conditions apply: **just do it.**

**Rule 0 and Rule 5 interaction — resolution is silent, execution is silent:**
Rule 0 mandates *resolution* of every required field before acting (Path A: read from profile; Path B: live introspect; runtime-state fields: live in both paths). Rule 5 mandates acting without asking or narrating. These do not conflict: resolution runs in parallel and silently (the user never sees it). Rule 5 governs the execution phase — do not narrate steps, do not ask for permission to execute, do not report intermediate resolution results. Only the final outcome is reported. "Resolve + silent execution" is the expected pattern for every command. **"Resolution" is not "exhaustive live introspection":** in Path A it collapses to profile reads + the small set of runtime-state live calls (Rule 14 / RULES-MOTION.md Rule 3 Step 1). Reading the word "introspection" in any rule as "always run live discovery" is a Rule 14 violation when Path A is active.

**Explicit list of things that must never trigger a question:**
- "Should I run this command?" — No. Run it.
- "Would you like me to proceed?" — No. Proceed.
- "Do you want me to use X topic?" — No. Use it.
- "Shall I launch the file now?" — No. Launch it.
- "Do you want me to set this parameter?" — No. Set it.
- "I found Y — would you like me to use it?" — No. Use it.
- "Would you like me to use the closed-loop workflow?" — No. Use it.
- "Would you like me to auto-detect the topics and run the command?" — No. Detect and run.
- "Would you like me to fetch the --help output?" — No. Fetch it and proceed.
- "The command timed out — would you like to check odometry / retry / troubleshoot?" — No. Check odometry and report findings immediately, without asking first.
- "The subcommand does not exist — would you like me to retry with the correct one?" — No. Run `--help`, find the correct subcommand, retry immediately.
- "I used the wrong subcommand — shall I try again?" — No. Try again.

### Rule 6 — Minimal reporting by default

**Keep output minimal. The user wants results, not narration.**

| Situation | What to report |
|---|---|
| Operation succeeded | One line: what was done and the key outcome. Example: "Done. Moved 1.02 m forward." |
| Movement completed | Start position (from pre-motion baseline, Rule 9), end position (from post-motion odom subscribe, Rule 8), actual distance/angle travelled — **all values must come from fresh `<ODOM_TOPIC>` subscribe calls, never from calculation or estimation**. Include anomalies (timeout, open-loop fallback). |
| No suitable topic/source found | Clear error with what was searched and what to try next |
| Safety condition triggered | Immediate notification with what happened and what was sent (stop command) |
| Operation failed | Error message with cause and recovery suggestion |

**Never report by default:**
- The topic name selected, unless it is ambiguous or unexpected
- The message type discovered
- Intermediate introspection results
- Step-by-step narration of what you are about to do
- A list of upcoming discovery steps ("Proceeding to: * Discover X * Discover Y …") — run them silently and report only the outcome
- Any preamble label like "Strict compliance:", "Executing:", "Running:", or similar — never open a response with a status label
- References to the tool being used — never say "using ros2-skill", "via ros2-skill's X utility", "using the ros2-skill tool", or any equivalent; the user knows what tool is in use
- **Any mention of profile-lookup activity in Path A.** The user must perceive Path A as instant. Do not write "I checked the profile and found…", "Reading `summary.cmd_vel_topic`…", "Profile says…", or any equivalent narration of static-data resolution. Profile reads are silent. Only the action and its outcome are reported.

**Always report (even in minimal mode):**
- Self-corrections: if a rule violation was caught mid-execution, report it in one line — what was about to be violated, what was caught, and what was done instead. Example: *"Caught: was about to use `launch start` (hallucinated subcommand). Corrected to `launch new`. Retrying."*

**Report everything (verbose mode) only when the user explicitly asks** — e.g. "show me what topics you found", "give me the full details", "what type did you use?"

### Rule 10 — Empty discovery: broaden the search, never guess

When `topics find <type>` returns an empty list:

1. **Do not guess a topic name.**
2. **Do not fall back to a hardcoded name** (Rule 0).
3. **Retry once before broadening.** ROS 2 DDS discovery is eventually-consistent — a node that started seconds ago may not yet be visible to the daemon. Wait 1 s and re-run the exact same `topics find` command. If the second call returns a result, use it. If still empty, proceed to step 4.
4. **Broaden the search immediately and in parallel:**
   ```bash
   topics list    # All active topics — scan for anything plausibly relevant
   nodes list     # Are the nodes that publish this type even running?
   ```
4. **If nodes are missing:** the robot stack may not be up. Run `doctor` and report what is absent.
5. **If nodes are running but topic is absent:** the publisher may not have started yet, or the topic may be differently typed than expected. Check `nodes details <candidate_node>` for its published topics.
6. **Report exactly:** what was searched, what `topics list` and `nodes list` returned, and one specific next step. Never present a menu. Never speculate.

**Terminal case — complete stack failure:** If `topics list` returns empty **and** `nodes list` returns empty:
- The entire robot stack is not running. Do not attempt any robot operations.
- Run `doctor` to confirm and capture the failure report.
- Report: *"No nodes or topics found. The robot stack appears to be offline. Bring up the robot bringup before retrying."*
- This is the only situation where further introspection is pointless — escalate immediately with the doctor output.

**This rule applies equally to `services find`, `actions find`, and any other type-based search.** Empty results are information, not permission to guess.

### Rule 11 — Use discovered names verbatim; never mutate them

Topic names, service names, action names, node names, and TF frame names returned by discovery commands must be used **exactly as returned** — character for character, including leading slashes, namespace prefixes, and suffixes.

**Never:**
- Strip a namespace prefix (e.g., convert `/robot_1/cmd_vel` → `/cmd_vel`)
- Add a namespace that was not in the discovery result
- Normalise, shorten, or "clean up" a discovered name
- Assume that a short name and a namespaced name refer to the same entity

**When multiple topics of the same type exist**, apply this selection algorithm:

1. **Match against user context keywords first:**

   | User mentioned... | Prefer topics containing... |
   |---|---|
   | "front camera", "forward camera" | `front`, `forward`, `rgb`, `color` |
   | "rear camera", "back camera" | `rear`, `back` |
   | "arm", "manipulator" | `arm`, `manip`, `wrist`, `elbow` |
   | "robot 1", "robot_1", specific robot name | that robot's namespace prefix |
   | "primary", "main", "base" LiDAR/sensor | `front`, `base`, `main`, `primary` |
   | No context clue | use the **first result** |

2. **If context resolves to exactly one candidate:** use it. State the selection in the report whenever more than one candidate existed.
3. **If no context keywords apply, or multiple candidates remain after keyword matching:** use the first result. Always state the selection in the report when more than one candidate existed. Do not ask the user (Rule 5).

**Multi-robot network exception — when namespaces suggest different robots:**
If discovery returns results from multiple distinct robot namespaces (e.g., `/robot_1/odom`, `/robot_2/odom`, `/robot_3/odom`) and no context clue in the conversation identifies which robot the user is addressing:
- This is the **one case where namespace selection requires a user question** (Rule 5, condition 1 — genuine ambiguity that introspection cannot resolve).
- Ask once, clearly: *"I found topics from multiple robots: robot_1, robot_2, robot_3. Which robot should I operate?"*
- Once confirmed, use only that robot's namespace for the entire task. Do not re-ask.

**Single namespace or same-robot duplicates:** never ask. Pick per context or first result and report.

### Rule 12 — Run independent discovery commands in parallel

**Path A (profile loaded) — zero static discovery.** If the profile covers every static field the task requires, run **no discovery commands** before execution. Proceed straight to runtime-state queries (controller active state, current odom, current joint positions) — those are still required for safety — and then to the action itself. Parallel discovery applies to the runtime-state queries: run them simultaneously.

**Path B (no profile) — parallel static discovery.** When a task requires discovering multiple independent static facts (velocity topic, odom topic, velocity limits, controller names), issue all discovery commands simultaneously — never sequentially.

Sequential discovery is slower and masks partial failures. If velocity discovery succeeds but odom discovery fails, sequential execution hides that failure until the motion command times out.

**Correct (parallel, Path B):**
```bash
# All three issued simultaneously
topics find geometry_msgs/msg/Twist
topics find geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped
topics find nav_msgs/msg/Odometry
```

**Wrong (sequential):**
```
topics find geometry_msgs/msg/Twist → wait → topics find TwistStamped → wait → ...
```

**This also applies to parameter scanning (Rule 0, Step 2):** run `params list <NODE>` for all nodes simultaneously, not one node at a time. Process all results together to find the binding velocity ceiling.

**Dependency exception:** if command B requires a result from command A (e.g., you need the topic name before you can check its type), sequential execution is correct for those two steps only. Run everything else in parallel around them.

**Dependency exception:** if command B requires a result from command A (e.g., you need the topic name before you can check its type), sequential execution is correct for those two steps only. Run everything else in parallel around them.

### Rule 13 — Profile data persists; runtime state does not

**Profile data (topic names, message types, joint mappings, limits, controller names, TF frame names) is valid for the entire session.** It was derived from static workspace analysis and does not change unless the workspace is rebuilt. Reusing profile fields across tasks is correct and required — it is what eliminates discovery latency.

**Runtime state must be re-checked per task.** Controller active/inactive state, node presence, lifecycle state, current joint positions, current odom pose — these can change between tasks: nodes crash, controllers switch, topics appear or disappear.

**Anti-rationalisation clause.** The following claims are all violations of this rule and must not be used to justify live introspection in Path A:

| False claim | Why it is false |
|---|---|
| *"Safety requires fresh introspection of names/types every task."* | Names and types do not become unsafe over time. They are static. Safety comes from re-checking runtime state (controller active, robot stationary), not from re-discovering names. |
| *"My workflow is designed for maximum safety / to catch runtime changes."* | Runtime changes are caught by the runtime-state checks listed below (controller state, node presence, lifecycle, stationary check). Re-discovering static names does not catch runtime changes — those names are not the thing that changes. |
| *"Live state is always more accurate than the profile."* | For static data (topic names, types, limits, frame names), live and profile must agree by construction. If they disagree, Rule 0.0b says escalate, not silently switch. |
| *"Profile data alone is never enough for actuation."* | The profile is enough for the static half. Runtime state (steps in this rule below) provides the dynamic half. Together they are sufficient. Adding redundant live discovery does not improve safety — it hides Rule 0.0b mismatches. |
| *"The profile is just a reference for static info; control and safety checks must be done live."* | Wrong dichotomy. Path A is **not** "profile for reference, live for control". Path A is: profile for static data (names, types, limits), live calls only for runtime state (controller active, stationary, payload template). Using `topics find` to "verify the cmd_vel topic before publishing" is re-discovering a name, not a safety check. |
| *"Using the profile is justified because it was just rescanned / is fresh."* | This implies the profile is normally untrustworthy and only acceptable when freshly rescanned. False. Path A trusts the profile **always** — Rule 0.0b is the mechanism that catches a stale profile (compare profile values to the live graph during the actions that already happen, stop on disagreement). The agent does not get to "decide the profile is fresh enough" each task — that gate is structural, not judgemental. |
| *"Best to be cautious and re-check everything."* | Re-checking profile-covered fields actively reduces safety because it masks profile↔live disagreements (Rule 0.0b). It also wastes time, increasing the window during which the robot's state can change before the command is issued. |

**If the user asks why you used live discovery in Path A, the correct response is not to defend it as caution.** The correct response is to recognise the violation, acknowledge it (without restating the false claims that motivated it), and use the profile next time.

**The correct behaviour:** read static data from the profile, run only the runtime-state checks listed below, then act.

**What must be re-checked at the start of each new task:**
- Controller state: `control list-controllers` — confirm the controller is still `active`
- Node presence (for critical nodes): `nodes list`
- Lifecycle state (if a lifecycle node is involved): `lifecycle nodes`
- Current sensor/joint state (for relative commands): subscribe for 1 message

**What does NOT need to be re-discovered per task (when profile is loaded):**
- Topic names, message types, joint names/indices, velocity limits, TF frame names — all come from the profile and are valid until a rescan

**Per-task re-discovery of profile-covered fields is wasted time.** Do not re-run `topics find`, `params list` limit sweeps, or controller name discovery between tasks when the profile already has these values.

**Mid-motion node crash monitoring — mandatory for commands with expected duration > 10 s:**
For any `publish-until` or `publish-sequence` whose calculated timeout exceeds 10 s, monitor the node graph during execution:
- Every 10 s (at each segment boundary if using long-motion segmentation from Rule 9), run `nodes list` in the background.
- Identify the critical nodes: the velocity controller node and the odom publisher node (both from the profile or discovered during pre-flight).
- **If either critical node disappears from `nodes list`:** immediately send `estop`, verify it took effect, then escalate: *"Critical node `<node_name>` crashed during motion at position X. Robot stopped. Cannot resume motion until node is restarted."* Do not attempt to continue motion.
- Short commands (≤ 10 s): node-crash monitoring is optional.

**If the graph changes unexpectedly mid-task** (a node disappears, a controller deactivates without being told to, a topic that was publishing goes silent):
1. Stop the current task.
2. Re-run the full Rule 0.1 session-start checks (`doctor`, clock check, lifecycle state).
3. Re-check runtime state — the system state is unknown. Profile data remains valid.
4. Report to the user: what changed, what the checks found, what the impact is.

**Never say "I already checked the live system" as a reason to skip re-checking runtime state.** Runtime state can change at any moment. Profile data, however, does not change between tasks — reusing it is correct.

### Rule 14 — Path A antipatterns (forbidden static-discovery commands)

When Path A is active (profile loaded), the following commands **must not run** for the purpose of resolving static data the profile already provides. Each row lists the forbidden command and the profile field that replaces it. Running any of these in Path A for static resolution is a rule violation under Rule 0 and Rule 13.

| Forbidden in Path A (for static resolution) | Use instead (profile field) |
|---|---|
| `topics find geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` | `summary.cmd_vel_topic` |
| `topics find geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped` | `summary.cmd_vel_topic` |
| `topics type <cmd_vel_topic>` | `summary.velocity_topics[].type` |
| `topics find nav_msgs/msg/Odometry` | `summary.localization_config.fused_sources` |
| `tf list` (to read frame names) | `summary.tf_frames` |
| `services find std_srvs/srv/SetBool` (for e-stop) | `summary.estop_config.service_name` |
| `params list` velocity-limit sweep across all nodes | `summary.safety_limits.binding` |
| `control list-controllers` **to read controller names** | `summary.active_controllers` |
| `pkg list` / `pkg executables` (for known robot packages) | `summary.packages`, `summary.launch_files` |

**Permitted live calls in Path A (runtime state only, not static data):**
- `control list-controllers` — but **only** to read the `state` field (active / inactive). Names come from the profile.
- `topics subscribe <topic>` — current sensor or odom values
- `topics hz <topic>` — current publish rate
- `lifecycle nodes` / `lifecycle get <node>` — current lifecycle state
- `nodes list` — current node presence

**If you find yourself about to type a command from the forbidden column in Path A:** stop. Read the profile field instead. The presence of the profile is exactly what makes that discovery unnecessary.

## Quick Decision Card

**Every user request follows this pattern:**

```
User: "do X"
Agent thinks:
  1. Is X about reading data? → Use TOPICS SUBSCRIBE
  2. Is X about movement (any kind)? → Follow the Movement Workflow (Rule 3)
  3. Is X a one-time trigger? → Use SERVICES CALL or ACTIONS SEND
  4. Is X about system info? → Use LIST commands

Agent does (for movement):
  1. Velocity topic: use summary.cmd_vel_topic from profile; if absent: topics find geometry_msgs/Twist + TwistStamped
  2. Odom topic: use summary.localization_config.fused_sources from profile; if absent: topics find nav_msgs/Odometry
  3. Velocity limits: use summary.safety_limits.binding from profile; if absent: four-source live sweep (Rule 28)
  4. Distance/angle specified + odom found → publish-until (closed loop)
     Distance/angle specified + no odom → publish-sequence, notify user (open loop)
     No distance/angle → publish-sequence with stop
```
