# ROS 2 Skill

> **⚠️ ATTENTION — READ FIRST. This block overrides any conflicting instinct or rationalisation below.**
>
> If `profile show` returns a non-empty `summary`, the session is **Path A**. In Path A:
>
> - **Do not run `topics find`, `topics type`, `tf list` (for frame names), `services find`, or a `params list` velocity-limit sweep for any data the profile already holds.** This is a Rule 14 violation, not "extra safety".
> - The profile fields are the source of truth for: `cmd_vel_topic`, velocity message type, odometry topic, velocity safety limits, TF frame names, controller names, e-stop service, joint names.
> - The **only** live calls allowed before motion in Path A: (1) `control list-controllers` for runtime active/inactive state, (2) one odom subscribe for the stationary check, (3) `interface proto <VEL_TYPE>` once per session for the payload template, (4) optional `topics hz` if you have not yet seen the odom rate.
> - **Forbidden rationalisations** (if you find yourself thinking any of these, you are violating Rule 13 — stop and use the profile):
>   - *"Maximum safety requires live introspection."*
>   - *"This catches runtime changes the profile might miss."*
>   - *"The profile is just a reference for static info; control and safety checks must be done live."*
>   - *"Profile data alone is never enough for actuation."*
>   - *"Using the profile is justified **because it was just rescanned** / **because it is fresh**."* — The profile is the source of truth for static data **always** in Path A, not just when fresh. If you think the profile might be stale, run Rule 0.0b escalation (compare to live graph and stop on disagreement); do not bypass with live discovery.
> - The single test before any introspection: *"Is this field present in the profile?"* — yes → use it; no → fall back to live for **that one field only** (Rule 0.0a); disagrees with live graph → stop and escalate (Rule 0.0b). The path does not flip.
>
> Detailed Path A operational rules: see "Path A operational summary" section below. Authoritative rules: `references/RULES-CORE.md` Rule 13 + Rule 14, `references/RULES-MOTION.md` Rule 3 Step 1.
>
> **Structural enforcement (since v1.0.8):** the CLI itself refuses `topics find` / `services find` calls that violate Path A. The refusal JSON names the matching profile field. `profile show` always includes a `path_a_reminder` block listing forbidden commands and the profile fields that replace them. Read that block at session start — it is the contract. If the guard refuses a call you genuinely need (Path B / debug), pass `--ignore-profile`; that override is logged.

Provides a structured JSON interface to a live ROS 2 robot. All commands output JSON. Every skill invocation follows three mandatory phases: **resolve → act → verify**. **Resolve** means: read every static field (topic names, message types, limits, frame names, controller names) from the profile first (Path A) and run a live call **only** when (a) the profile is absent / does not have that field (Path B / Rule 0.0a), or (b) the value is dynamic runtime state — controller active/inactive, robot stationary, payload template, odom rate. **"Resolve" is not a synonym for "introspect everything live"** — in Path A it collapses to zero live calls for profile-covered fields. **Act** issues the command. **Verify** reads post-action state. Never skip any phase, and never expand "resolve" into full live discovery when Path A is active.

## Entry Point

**Always use `ros2_cli.py`. Never call `ros2` directly or run submodules directly.**

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py <command> [subcommand] [args]
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py --help           # list all commands
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py <command> --help # list subcommands
```

`{baseDir}` is the path to the skill root directory. Resolve it from the skill metadata before running any command.

---

## Session Start Checklist

Run once per session before the first task. Takes seconds. Catches the most common silent failures.

```bash
# Step 1 — health check
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py doctor

# Step 2 — daemon
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py daemon status
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py daemon start      # if not running

# Step 3 — simulated time (if applicable)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics find rosgraph_msgs/msg/Clock

# Step 4 — lifecycle nodes (if present)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py lifecycle nodes

# Step 5 — log directory (no command — note for diagnostics)
# Resolve: $ROS_LOG_DIR → $ROS_HOME/log/ → ~/.ros/log/

# Step 6 — graph snapshot
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py context          # topics (cap 50), services, actions, nodes

# Step 7 — robot profile (load if available; skip if absent)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py profile show
# → robot_type, packages, launch_files, velocity_topics, safety_limits, sensor_flags
#
# Path classification (decided once, here):
#   profile show succeeded AND summary is non-empty  → Path A (profile-first)
#   profile show failed OR summary is empty          → Path B (live introspection for everything)
# Do NOT re-classify per task. Auto-rescan, freshness gating, and `profile scan` triggers:
# see RULES-PREFLIGHT.md Rules 0.0, 0.6, 0.7 (loaded at session start).
#
# If absent: build once, using these rules derived from the user's request:
#
#   ONE robot named  → pass --name <robot_name>  (pkg filter is auto-derived from the name)
#     python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py profile scan --name lekiwi
#     python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py profile scan --name depthai
#
#   MULTIPLE robots named  → pass --packages <r1>,<r2> plus --name <combined_label>
#     python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py profile scan --packages lekiwi,quest_teleop --name lekiwi_quest
#
#   NO robot name given (bare "create a profile" / "scan workspace")  → omit both flags
#     python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py profile scan
#
# Use summary.safety_limits as the --max-vel / --max-ang ceiling (Rule 28).
```

Stop and tell the user if Step 1 reports critical failures. Re-run Step 3 before every timed command in simulation.

---

## Path A operational summary (READ BEFORE EVERY ACTION when profile is loaded)

**When `profile show` returned a non-empty `summary` at Step 7, the session is Path A. In Path A, the profile is the source of truth for static data — running live discovery for data the profile already holds is a rule violation (Rule 14), not extra safety.**

**Use directly from the profile — zero live calls:**

| Need | Profile field | Forbidden in Path A |
|---|---|---|
| Velocity command topic | `summary.cmd_vel_topic` | `topics find geometry_msgs/msg/Twist`, `topics find geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped` |
| Velocity message type | `summary.velocity_topics[].type` (entry matching `cmd_vel_topic`) | `topics type <topic>` |
| Odometry topic | first value of `summary.localization_config.fused_sources` | `topics find nav_msgs/msg/Odometry` |
| Velocity safety ceiling | `summary.safety_limits.binding.{linear_x,linear_y,angular_z}` | `nodes list` + `params list` sweep for `max/limit/vel/speed/accel` |
| TF frame names | `summary.tf_frames.{odom_frame,base_frame,map_frame}` | `tf list` for frame names |
| Controller names | `summary.active_controllers` | using `control list-controllers` to *discover* controller names (still required to check runtime state — see below) |
| E-stop service | `summary.estop_config.service_name` | `services find std_srvs/srv/SetBool` |
| Joint names / order / index | `summary.hardware_interfaces[].joints`, `summary.joint_limits` | `params get /controller_manager:joints`, parsing `robot_description` |

**The only live calls still mandatory before motion in Path A** (these read runtime state, which the profile cannot know):

1. `control list-controllers` — confirm the controller named in `summary.active_controllers` is `active` right now.
2. Subscribe `<ODOM_TOPIC> --max-messages 1 --timeout 2` — confirm robot is stationary (Rule 9). This double-serves as a liveness check on the odom topic.
3. `interface proto <VEL_TYPE>` — once per session, get the payload template (the type came from the profile, but the field layout did not).
4. Optional: `topics hz <ODOM_TOPIC> --duration 2` if `publish-until` is being used and you have not confirmed odom rate this session.

**Path A violation — worked counterexample (what NOT to do):**

User request: *"drive forward 1 m"*. Profile is loaded.

```
❌ topics find geometry_msgs/msg/Twist             # Rule 14: profile has cmd_vel_topic
❌ topics find geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped      # Rule 14: profile has velocity_topics[].type
❌ topics find nav_msgs/msg/Odometry               # Rule 14: profile has fused_sources
❌ topics type <discovered_topic>                  # Rule 14: profile has the type
❌ nodes list && params list <each-node>           # Rule 14: profile has safety_limits.binding
```

Cost of the violation: 5–30 seconds wasted, **and** if any `topics find` returns a topic that disagrees with the profile, the agent will silently use the live answer — masking the disagreement that Rule 0.0b is specifically designed to surface. Live discovery in Path A is not "extra safety"; it actively hides safety-relevant mismatches and delays the command.

**Correct Path A motion sequence:**

```
✅ Read VEL_TOPIC, VEL_TYPE, ODOM_TOPIC, MAX_VEL, MAX_ANG from profile  (0 live calls)
✅ interface proto <VEL_TYPE>                                           (1 live call, once/session)
✅ control list-controllers                                             (1 live call — runtime state)
✅ topics subscribe <ODOM_TOPIC> --max-messages 1 --timeout 2           (1 live call — stationary + liveness)
✅ topics publish-until <VEL_TOPIC> '<payload>' --monitor <ODOM_TOPIC>   (the actual command)
✅ topics subscribe <ODOM_TOPIC> --max-messages 1 --timeout 2           (post-motion verify, Rule 8)
```

3 live calls before the command + 1 after. Not the 6–9 live discovery calls of Path B.

**If a profile field is missing** (Rule 0.0a): fall back to live discovery for **that one field only** — the path does not flip. Other fields stay on the profile.

**If a profile field's value disagrees with the live graph** (e.g., `summary.cmd_vel_topic` is not in `topics list`): stop and escalate per Rule 0.0b. Do not silently retry with live discovery.

---

## Critical Rules

Read the domain-specific rule files from `references/` before the first action. These are hard constraints — not guidelines. Use [`references/RULES.md`](references/RULES.md) as the index to find the right file. **Always load at session start: `RULES-CORE.md`, `RULES-PREFLIGHT.md`, and `RULES-MOTION.md`.** Add `RULES-DIAGNOSTICS.md` when something fails. Key principles:

1. **Two-Path Model — profile first, live fallback.** Path A (profile loaded) uses profile fields for static data and live calls only for runtime state; Path B (no profile) does full live introspection. Path is fixed for the session, decided once at Step 7. Never hardcode names, types, or limits. Full guardrails (field-presence rules, exact field names, escalation on runtime mismatch, auto-rescan gating, scan triggers) live in **RULES-PREFLIGHT.md Rules 0.0, 0.0a, 0.0b, 0.6, 0.7** and **RULES-CORE.md Rules 13, 14**.

2. **Get the payload template.** Before publishing or calling: `interface proto <msg_type>`. Copy the output. Modify only the fields the task requires. For non-primitive nested fields, run `interface show <nested_type>` recursively until all leaf fields are primitives.

3. **Verify every effect.** A zero-error CLI response means the request was delivered — not that the effect occurred. Always follow up: `params get`, `control list-controllers`, subscribe to confirm, etc.

4. **Diagnose before reporting.** On any error: introspect → self-correct → retry → report. Never ask the user to interpret an error you can check with the CLI.

5. **Safety is non-negotiable.** Velocity limits, pre-motion odom checks, and post-motion verify are mandatory. Never bypass them.

6. **Context discovery is parallel.** When discovering multiple independent facts (velocity topic, odom topic, limits, controller state), issue all commands simultaneously — never sequentially.

## Common Operations

### Introspection

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py context                             # session-start graph snapshot
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics list [--limit N]             # list topics (cap at N)
# Velocity topic — profile fast-path: use summary.cmd_vel_topic + summary.velocity_topics[].type
# Odom topic — profile fast-path: use summary.localization_config.fused_sources values
# Fallback (profile absent or field missing):
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics find geometry_msgs/msg/Twist # find velocity topic
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics find nav_msgs/msg/Odometry   # find odom topic
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics type <topic>                 # confirm exact type
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics details <topic>              # publisher count + QoS
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics hz <topic>                   # confirm topic is live
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py nodes list
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py services list
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py actions list
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py tf list                             # discover TF frames
```

### Publishing

**Path A (profile loaded):** resolve `<VEL_TOPIC>` and `<VEL_TYPE>` from the profile — do NOT run `topics find` / `topics type`. See "Path A operational summary" above.

```bash
# Path A field resolution (no live calls):
#   VEL_TOPIC     = summary.cmd_vel_topic                          (e.g. /base_controller/cmd_vel)
#   VEL_TYPE      = summary.velocity_topics[].type                 (e.g. geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped)
#   ODOM_TOPIC    = first value of summary.localization_config.fused_sources   (e.g. /base_controller/odom)
#   MAX_VEL       = summary.safety_limits.binding.linear_x
#   MAX_ANG       = summary.safety_limits.binding.angular_z
# Path B (no profile): discover via `topics find geometry_msgs/msg/Twist` and
# `topics find geometry_msgs/msg/TwistStamped`, then `topics type` to confirm.

# Get payload template once per session — always; the type may be Twist OR TwistStamped
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py interface proto <VEL_TYPE>
# Twist:        {"linear":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0},"angular":{"x":0,"y":0,"z":0}}
# TwistStamped: {"header":{"stamp":{"sec":0},"frame_id":""},"twist":{"linear":{...},"angular":{...}}}

# Single publish
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics publish <VEL_TOPIC> '<json matching VEL_TYPE>' \
  --max-vel <MAX_VEL> --max-ang <MAX_ANG>

# Closed-loop linear (Euclidean distance) — payload shape depends on VEL_TYPE
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics publish-until <VEL_TOPIC> \
  '<json matching VEL_TYPE>' \
  --monitor <ODOM_TOPIC> --field pose.pose.position --euclidean --delta 1.0 --timeout 60 \
  --max-vel <MAX_VEL> --max-ang <MAX_ANG>

# Closed-loop rotation (sign of --rotate MUST match sign of angular.z)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics publish-until <VEL_TOPIC> \
  '<json with angular.z = +omega>' \
  --monitor <ODOM_TOPIC> --rotate 90 --degrees --timeout 30 \
  --max-vel <MAX_VEL> --max-ang <MAX_ANG>

# Subscribe (read sensor data)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics subscribe <topic> --max-messages 1 --timeout 5

# Subscribe and return the first message only, then exit
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics echo-once <topic> [--timeout 5]
```

**`--max-vel N` / `--max-ang N`** (Twist / TwistStamped only): clamp linear x/y/z to ±N m/s and angular.z to ±N rad/s inside the CLI before the message is sent. Pass `summary.safety_limits.binding.linear_x` / `.angular_z` from the profile (Path A) or the Rule 28 limit-scan result (Path B). Clamped axes are reported in `velocity_clamped` in the JSON output. Other message types pass through unchanged.

### Services and Actions

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py services details <service>          # request/response fields
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py services call <service> '<json>'
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py actions details <action>            # goal/result/feedback fields
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py actions send <action> '<json>' --timeout 60
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py actions cancel <goal_id>
```

### Parameters

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py params list <node>
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py params describe <node:param>        # type, range, read-only
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py params get <node:param>
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py params set <node:param> <value>
```

### Controllers and Lifecycle

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py control list-controllers
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py control list-hardware-components
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py control switch-controllers --activate <name> --deactivate <name>
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py lifecycle nodes
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py lifecycle get <node>
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py lifecycle set <node> activate
```

### Camera and Images

```bash
# Always verify camera_info + TF before using camera data
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics find sensor_msgs/msg/CameraInfo
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics subscribe <camera_info_topic> --max-messages 1 --timeout 2
# Confirm K matrix is non-zero and frame_id is in tf list before proceeding

# Capture image — profile-aware: if a robot profile is loaded and the URDF shows
# the camera is mounted at a non-upright angle (e.g. upside-down = roll ≈ ±π),
# the image is automatically rotated before being saved.
# Output JSON includes: {success, path, profile_applied, image_rotated_deg}
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics capture-image --topic <camera_topic> --output {baseDir}/.artifacts/<name>.jpg

# Skip profile-driven rotation (e.g. the detected rotation is wrong for this capture):
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics capture-image --topic <camera_topic> --output {baseDir}/.artifacts/<name>.jpg --no-profile

# Read depth at a specific pixel from a depth image topic (16UC1 or 32FC1; no numpy/cv2 needed)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics depth-point --topic <depth_topic> --u <col> --v <row>
# Returns: {depth_m, invalid, encoding, width, height}
```

### Diagnostics and Health

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py doctor                              # full DDS/graph health check
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py doctor hello                        # DDS multicast test
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics diag                         # subscribe /diagnostics
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py topics battery                      # battery state
```

### Launch

```bash
# Find a launch file by keyword
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch list <keyword>

# Start a launch file (duplicate detection runs automatically)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch new <package> <launch_file>

# With launch arguments (name:=value — passed directly to the launch file, highest priority)
# This is the correct form for any launch argument: use_sim_time:=true, robot_name:=my_bot, etc.
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch new <package> <launch_file> use_sim_time:=true
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch new <package> <launch_file> use_sim_time:=true robot_name:=my_bot

# With comma-separated launch arguments via --param (same as positional args but lower priority)
# Use this when the arg list is long or dynamic — positional args always win over --param on conflict
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch new <package> <launch_file> --param use_sim_time:=true,robot_name:=my_bot

# ⚠️  --config-path is for YAML node-parameter files only (forwarded via --ros-args --params-file)
# Do NOT use --config-path for launch arguments like config:=k2 — use positional args instead
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch new <package> <launch_file> --config-path /path/to/config.yaml

# With a saved parameter preset (lowest priority — positional and --param override)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch new <package> <launch_file> --preset my_preset

# Manage sessions
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch list                         # running launch sessions
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch kill <session>               # stop a session
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py launch restart <session>            # restart with same args
```

**Priority order** (ROS 2 last-wins): positional args > `--param` > `--preset`. Positional args always win on conflict.
**`--config-path`** is independent of the priority stack — it adds `--ros-args --params-file <file>` to launched nodes; it does not set launch arguments.
**Duplicate detection**: if the same package + launch file is already running, a warning with `existing_session` is returned instead of launching again.

### Log Introspection

Works without a live ROS 2 graph — reads `~/.ros/log/` (or `$ROS_LOG_DIR`).

```bash
# Discover available runs (newest first)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py logs list-runs [--limit 20]

# Query entries with filters (default: latest run, all severities)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py logs query [--run <id>] [--severity WARN] \
  [--node <name>] [--after -30s] [--before -5m] [--text <substr>] [--regex <pat>] \
  [--max 200]

# Incremental tail — only entries since the last call (persists offsets)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py logs tail [--run <id>] [--initial-lines 50] \
  [--reset]

# Per-node statistics: totals, severity breakdown, top recurring messages
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py logs node-summary [--run <id>] [--top 5]
```

**Time filter formats for `--after` / `--before`:** `-30s`, `-5m`, `-2h` (relative to now), epoch float, or ISO datetime (`2026-04-30T10:00:00`).

**`logs tail` workflow:** Call once to seed offsets (returns last ~50 lines); call again during the run to get only new entries. Use `--reset` to re-seed when switching to a new run.

### Packages, Bags, and TF

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py pkg list                            # installed packages (no graph)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py pkg prefix <package>                # install prefix
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py pkg executables <package>           # launchable executables
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py pkg xml <package>                   # package.xml contents
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py pkg create <name> [--build-type ament_cmake|ament_python|cmake] \
    [--dependencies rclcpp std_msgs] [--node-name my_node] [--library-name my_lib] \
    [--destination-directory /path]                                        # scaffold new package (no graph)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py bag info <bag_path>                 # bag metadata (no graph)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py tf list                             # all TF frames
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py tf echo <source_frame> <target_frame>
```

### Robot Profile (no live graph required)

Build once; load every session. The profile captures robot type, packages, launch files (as filenames from the workspace), velocity topics, safety limits, and sensor flags — eliminating per-session re-discovery.

```bash

**Robot type values:** `humanoid` · `legged` · `aerial` · `underwater` · `surface_vessel` · `mobile_manipulator` · `arm` · `mobile_base` · `unknown`

**Detection rules (applied strictly in this order):**
1. Humanoid — specific platform package name (NAO, Atlas, Valkyrie …) **or** ≥ 4 URDF joints with torso/neck/shoulder/elbow patterns. Generic terms like "walking"/"balance" are intentionally excluded (too broad).
2. Legged — specific quadruped/hexapod package name (Spot, Go1, ANYmal …) or ≥ 4 URDF joints with FL/FR/RL/RR leg naming.
3. Aerial, underwater, surface\_vessel — platform-specific package names or source keywords.
4. Mobile manipulator — both mobile-base *and* arm signals present.
5. Arm — arm/gripper/MoveIt package or ≥ 3 non-wheel URDF joints.
6. Mobile base — velocity topics (`/cmd_vel`) or Nav2 present, or explicit diff-drive/Ackermann packages.

**If detection is wrong:** run `profile scan --robot-type <type>` to override. The evidence field always shows what matched so you can see why a type was chosen.

Use `summary.safety_limits.binding.linear_x` as the `--max-vel` ceiling and `summary.safety_limits.binding.angular_z` as the `--max-ang` ceiling (Rule 28). `binding.linear_y` is set for holonomic robots. `sources` lists every config file that contributed a limit — useful when multiple teleop configs are present. Use `summary.launch_files` to see what launch files exist in the workspace; load any one's full detail with `--section <filename>`. Launch arg defaults and choices are always populated — a missing `default` key means the argument is required with no declared default.

## Output Folders

All outputs are written to hidden folders inside the skill directory. Never use `/tmp`.

| Folder | Contents |
|---|---|
| `{baseDir}/.artifacts/` | Captured images, logs, and all generated outputs |
| `{baseDir}/.presets/` | Saved parameter presets (`params preset-save` / `params preset-load`) |
| `{baseDir}/.profiles/` | Robot profiles |

---

## Emergency Stop

Send immediately on any unsafe motion or unexpected robot behaviour:

```bash
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py estop
```

After estop: verify velocity ≈ 0 by subscribing `<ODOM_TOPIC> --max-messages 1 --timeout 5`. If velocity is still non-zero after 5 s (10 s for heavy platforms > 20 kg), escalate as critical failure.

---

## Nav2 Navigation

Send autonomous navigation goals to the Nav2 stack (`NavigateToPose` action). Requires Nav2 to be running on the robot.

```bash
# Navigate to a map pose and wait for completion (up to 120 s)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py nav2 go 1.5 -0.3

# With heading constraint
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py nav2 go 1.5 -0.3 --yaw 90

# Waypoint sequence (chained NavigateToPose calls)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py nav2 go-waypoints 1.0,0.0 2.0,1.5 3.0,0.0

# Cancel active goal + send zero-velocity burst
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py nav2 cancel

# Check whether Nav2 is active and report current feedback
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py nav2 status

# Set AMCL initial pose (slam_mode: amcl only)
python3 {baseDir}/scripts/ros2_cli.py nav2 initial-pose 1.0 2.0 --yaw 45
```

**Key flags:**
- `--frame MAP` — coordinate frame (default: `map`)
- `--timeout 120` — seconds to wait for goal completion (default: 120; navigation can take minutes)
- `--feedback` — include per-step feedback messages in output (`nav2 go` only)
- `--no-stop-on-failure` — continue waypoint sequence even if one leg fails (`go-waypoints`)

**Output fields (`nav2 go`):** `success` (bool), `status` (int, 4=SUCCEEDED), `status_name`, `goal {x,y,frame}`, `error?`

**Before `nav2 go`:** always run `nav2 cancel` first if a previous goal may still be active (Rule 9 pre-motion check). Use `nav2 status` to confirm no active goal is present.

## Commands Without a Live Graph

These work without ROS running or nodes active:

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `version` | Verify skill is installed and reachable |
| `daemon status / start / stop` | Manage the ROS 2 daemon |
| `bag info <file>` | Bag metadata (duration, message counts, per-topic stats) |
| `logs list-runs` | List available ROS 2 log runs in the log directory |
| `logs query` | Filter log entries by severity, node, time, text |
| `logs tail` | Incremental log reading (new entries since last call) |
| `logs node-summary` | Per-node log statistics for a run |
| `component types` | List registered composable node types |
| `--help` on any command | Inspect flags and subcommands |
| `pkg list / prefix / executables / xml` | Package introspection |
| `pkg create <name> [flags]` | Scaffold a new ROS 2 package |
| `profile scan [--workspace PATH] [--packages PATTERNS] [--robot-type TYPE]` | Build robot profile; `--packages lekiwi` fuzzy-matches packages by name/path (comma-separated for multiple patterns); `--robot-type` overrides detection |
| `profile show [--section S]` | Show saved robot profile or a section (always includes annotations) |
| `profile rescan [--launch-file F] [--packages PATTERNS]` | Update existing profile; `--packages` filter is reused automatically from the saved profile unless overridden |
| `profile list` | List all saved robot profiles |
| `profile annotate "note"` | Append a free-text note to the profile (read at every session start) |

---

## Reference Files

This skill uses **progressive disclosure**. SKILL.md covers the most common operations. Load the files below when the task requires deeper detail.

| File | When to load |
|---|---|
| [`references/RULES.md`](references/RULES.md) | **Index only** — maps each rule number to its domain file. Load first to navigate the rule set. |
| [`references/RULES-CORE.md`](references/RULES-CORE.md) | **Always load** — general agent conduct (Rules 0.5, 1, 2, 4–6, 10–13). Hard constraints that apply to every command. Includes mandatory compliance preamble and Quick Decision Card. |
| [`references/RULES-PREFLIGHT.md`](references/RULES-PREFLIGHT.md) | **Load at session start and before any action** — full pre-flight introspection protocol (Rule 0), session-start steps 0–6 (Rule 0.1), lifecycle/QoS/publisher checks (Rules 14, 15, 19). |
| [`references/RULES-MOTION.md`](references/RULES-MOTION.md) | **Always load at session start** (any mobile-base or arm robot may receive a motion command) — movement algorithm (Rule 3), pre-motion check + Nav2 preemption (Rule 9), REP-103/105 (Rule 17), estop (Rule 18), decel zone (Rule 20), timeout recovery (Rule 21), command limits (Rules 22–23), sequencing (Rule 24), proximity scan (Rule 25). Step 1 of Rule 3 is the authoritative source on the profile fast-path for motion. |
| [`references/RULES-DIAGNOSTICS.md`](references/RULES-DIAGNOSTICS.md) | **Load when something fails** — failure diagnosis + log-level elevation (Rule 7), post-action verification table (Rule 8), multi-step sequencing (Rule 16), Error Recovery Protocols. |
| [`references/RULES-REFERENCE.md`](references/RULES-REFERENCE.md) | **Load for command lookup** — full intent→command table (Step 1), sensor search by type (Steps 2–3), message structure (Step 4), velocity limits (Step 5), Launch workflow, Discord image delivery (Rule 26), Setup. |
| [`references/COMMANDS.md`](references/COMMANDS.md) | Load when you need the exact flag name, argument format, or JSON output structure for a specific command. 4535 lines — use `--help` on the specific subcommand first; only load this file if `--help` is insufficient or unavailable. |
| [`references/EXAMPLES.md`](references/EXAMPLES.md) | Load for step-by-step walkthroughs of common tasks (move N meters, capture camera image, send Nav2 goal, etc.). 699 lines. |
| [`references/CLI.md`](references/CLI.md) | Load for direct `ros2` CLI equivalents and debugging. Not needed during normal agent operation. 90 lines. |
| [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) | Load for the full agent operating protocol — condensed rules, session start detail, reporting style, subcommand inference, motion workflows, and multi-robot handling. Load alongside the RULES-*.md files at session start. |
