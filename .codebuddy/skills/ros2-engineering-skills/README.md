# ros2-engineering-skills

Agent skill for production-grade ROS 2 development — from first workspace to fleet deployment.

Works with [Claude Code](https://code.claude.com), [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex), [Cursor](https://cursor.sh), [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), and any agent supporting the [Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) standard.

## Before / After

> **Prompt:** *"My ROS 2 subscriber isn't receiving any sensor messages. Help me fix it."*

```python
# "Check your topic name and make sure
#  the publisher is running"
sub = node.create_subscription(
    Image, '/camera/image_raw',
    callback, 10)
```

Generic advice — misses the real issue.

```python
# Diagnoses QoS mismatch (DDS RxO rules):
# Sensor drivers default to BEST_EFFORT,
# but queue depth "10" implies RELIABLE.
from rclpy.qos import qos_profile_sensor_data

sub = node.create_subscription(
    Image, '/camera/image_raw',
    callback, qos_profile_sensor_data)
#          ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
# BEST_EFFORT + VOLATILE — matches sensor pub
```

Identifies the root cause, explains DDS Request-vs-Offered semantics, and applies the correct `qos_profile_sensor_data` preset.

## What this is

A `SKILL.md`-based knowledge module that gives AI coding agents deep ROS 2 engineering expertise. Instead of a shallow cheat sheet, it provides:

- **Decision frameworks** — when to use rclcpp vs rclpy, which QoS profile, lifecycle vs plain node
- **Progressive disclosure** — compact routing in `SKILL.md`, detailed patterns in `references/`
- **Full spectrum** — workspace setup through real-time tuning, Nav2, MoveIt 2, ros2_control, DDS configuration, cross-compilation, and CI/CD
- **Distro-aware** — explicit Humble / Jazzy / Kilted / Rolling differences with migration paths
- **Anti-pattern documentation** — what breaks in production and why

## How it differs from existing ROS 2 skills

| Aspect | Typical ROS 2 skill | This project |
|---|---|---|
| Depth | Basic QoS + lifecycle intro | DDS vendor tuning, custom executors, intra-process zero-copy, type adapters |
| Scope | Single SKILL.md file | 20 reference files via progressive disclosure |
| Hardware | Mentioned in passing | ros2_control hardware interface patterns, serial/CAN/EtherCAT, controller chaining |
| Real-time | Not covered | PREEMPT_RT, realtime_tools, memory allocation, callback group strategies |
| Simulation | Mentioned in passing | Gazebo version matrix, gz_ros2_control, Isaac Sim, sim-to-real |
| Security | Not covered | SROS2, DDS security plugins, certificate management, supply chain |
| Embedded | Not covered | micro-ROS, rclc, XRCE-DDS, ESP32/STM32/RP2040 |
| Multi-robot | Not covered | Open-RMF, fleet adapters, DDS discovery at scale, NTP/PTP sync |
| Testing | "Use pytest" | launch_testing, gtest, industrial_ci, simulation-in-the-loop CI |
| Deployment | Not covered | Docker multi-stage, cross-compile, fleet OTA, Zenoh routing |

## Current status

**Complete & Verified.** 20 reference files, 13,000+ lines of production-grade guidance, 7 utility/harness scripts (4 user-facing + 2 Skills 2.0 hooks + 1 eval harness) — all tested and **validated on live ROS 2 Jazzy environments.**

| | |
|---|---|
| **429 tests** | Unit + property-based (Hypothesis) + CLI + integration + Skills 2.0 hooks/evals + cross-doc consistency |
| **95% coverage** | All scripts verified with flake8 + mypy clean |
| **Real-world Evals** | **Validated empirically on WSL (Ubuntu 24.04 + ROS 2 Jazzy)** for SROS2, micro-ROS `rclc`, and Multi-robot fleet scenarios. The `eval_runner.py` performs *structural* checks on prompt/expected fixtures (keyword coverage of declared criteria); model-output quality is evaluated outside this runner. |
| **5 CI jobs** | Lint (flake8 + mypy + pip-audit), unit-tests (py 3.10/3.11/3.12 matrix), ros2-integration (humble/jazzy/rolling Docker matrix), markdown-lint, lint-scripts |

## Supported ROS 2 distributions

This skill is designed to work **on a complete, internally consistent ROS 2
installation**. The matrix below describes what "complete" means per distro,
and which combinations are CI-verified end-to-end.

| Distro | Status | CI verification | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Jazzy Jalisco** (LTS) | Primary target — recommended | Full pipeline (lint → unit → docker build → colcon test → smoke) | All scripts, scaffolds, and references default to Jazzy idioms |
| **Humble Hawksbill** (LTS) | Fully supported | Full pipeline | Distro-aware code paths handle 22.04 / older rosidl / pre-`HardwareComponentInterfaceParams` API |
| **Kilted Kaiju** (non-LTS, May 2025) | Reference-supported | Not in docker matrix (no `osrf/ros:kilted-desktop` image) | Zenoh Tier 1, EventsExecutor stable — references document the deltas |
| **Rolling Ridley** | CI-verified via source overlay of broken upstream packages | Full pipeline (rolling-only stage in Dockerfile) | See **Rolling caveat** below |
| **Foxy Fitzroy** (LTS, EOL June 2023) | Migration reference only | Not built | Documented for upgrade paths only |

### Rolling caveat

`Rolling` is, by ROS 2 policy, an upstream development distribution with no
ABI guarantees. During active refactors (e.g., the in-progress `rosidl`
split into `rosidl_buffer`, `rosidl_buffer_backend`, …), `packages.ros.org`
periodically enters states where freshly-rebuilt binary `.deb` files
(e.g. `control_msgs`, `hardware_interface`) declare CMake link-interface
targets whose providing packages have not yet propagated as standalone
debs — making `find_package(hardware_interface)` fail at CMake generate
time with `"target was not found"`.

This project handles that with a **source overlay** in
[tests/Dockerfile.ros2-test](tests/Dockerfile.ros2-test): on rolling
only, after the broken binaries are apt-installed, we clone every
upstream repo whose source tree currently underpins the broken Config
chain (every `rosidl*` repo from the canonical `ros2.repos` manifest,
plus `ros-controls/control_msgs` and `ros-controls/ros2_control`) and
`colcon build --merge-install --install-base /opt/ros/rolling` them as
one workspace. The regenerated `Config.cmake` files reference each
other consistently and overlay onto `/opt/ros/rolling`, replacing the
broken binary configs in place. A throwaway `find_package(hardware_interface)`
verification at the end of the overlay step fails fast if anything
remains unresolved.

For your own deployments on rolling, the same approach applies — clone
the `rosidl*`/`control_msgs`/`ros2_control` source trees and overlay
them with `colcon build --merge-install`.

For production work, **pick an LTS (Humble or Jazzy)**. Use rolling
only when you specifically need a feature that has not yet landed in
an LTS.

## Contributing

Contributions welcome. Please:

1. Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines — add depth in `references/`
2. Include working code examples, not pseudocode
3. Document anti-patterns alongside correct patterns
4. Note which ROS 2 distros your change applies to
5. Run `flake8 scripts/ tests/` and `mypy scripts/` before submitting
6. Ensure `pytest tests/ --cov=scripts --cov-fail-under=90` passes
7. Test with at least one agent (Claude Code, Codex, etc.)
